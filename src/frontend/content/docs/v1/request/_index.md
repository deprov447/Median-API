# Request

There are mainly 3 (but more) ways to make requests to this API
- ###  [Using a GraphQL Client](/docs/v1/request/reqUsingClient/)
- ###  [Using Postman](/docs/v1/request/reqUsingPostman/)
- ###  [Manual Request](/docs/v1/request/reqUsingFetch/)

<br>
It is recommended to use a GraphQL request client over postman/manual methods. This is because of self documentation features, schema resolution and mostly because they automate the HTTP details and let you focus only on essential components.

> Normal REST requests to endpoint won't work.
